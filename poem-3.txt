Shaykh Nishaat Ahmed Siddiqi

P: The Goal
The goal for the human being, 
especially in the Sufi path, 
is to know and to love Allah. 
Allah is The Beloved, The One, The Only. 

All the laws, the rules, the rituals, 
all the prophets throughout time, 
and the friends of Allah, 
both men and women, 
have come to teach 
this one truth 
- to know Allah.

Sufism 
is the name of this teaching, 
the path that offers a method 
to attain this goal. 
To reach it, 
one must become Insan-i Kamil, 
the mature human being, 
one who reflects 
the Attributes of Allah.
