Taskeen Noorbhai

P: Imagine

Imagine‚Ä¶

If we remembered - 
to tell those we love,
I love you.

Not just with words,
but with a sound that rises
from the depths of the soul,
from a place Known.
The place of All-ah! 
The place we get to call Home.

The frequency of the sound
that flows through you - flows through me.
Kun. Be!

Can‚Äôt you see?

Even to see
is only because of He.

Ya Basir.

And in the act of loving them,
we remember
where that Love comes from.

From You.
The Source of all Love.
The One who Loves.
The One who is Love.

Ya Wadud.
Ya Ahad.

Truthfully my remembrance of you, is actually Your Remembrance of me. 

‚ÄúRemember Me and I will remember you.‚Äù 
Qur‚Äôan Al Baqarah [152]

Oh! There is no greater Love.
The One that Remembers all. Knows all. 

Ya Alim
Ya Hafiz

And in that Zikr,
in that remembering,
we return.

We return to Truth.
We return to One.

Through the Love that was not only said,
but Written.
Maktoob.
Inscribed over our hearts,
from the very start.

Hmmmmmmm‚Ä¶ üòç
It makes me wander into that Reality, 
The Reality.

And I wonder‚Ä¶

Who might we become,
when we walk with One?
When we live in remembrance?
When we speak,
and Love,
and breathe ‚Äî
only through You?

Allah Hu!

Imagine.
Ameen

P: When I feel the Love inside of me

When I feel this love inside of me
This love for ya Habibi ya Nabi 
Salawaat is what I send  
Through the heavens may it transcend 

(Chorus)
So I call out Ya Rasulallah
The way He called out to Allah 
‚ÄúMy ummah my ummah‚Äù
Peace and blessings be to him 
Khatam-an Nabiyyin 
Rahmatal-lil-‚ÄòAlamin 

La ilaha illallah Muhammadur Rasoolullah (x2) 

Every night when I look at the moon -
Thinking of your face‚Äôs Nur  
Everywhere that I turn or go 
I somehow seem to see your glow 

As I go down this road 
Catching my grip on your rope 

(Chorus)
So I call out Ya Rasulallah
The way He called out to Allah 
‚ÄúMy ummah my ummah‚Äù
Peace and blessings be to him 
Khatam-an Nabiyyin 
Rahmatal-lil-‚ÄòAlamin  

La ilaha illallah Muhammadur Rasoolullah (x2)
