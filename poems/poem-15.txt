i went to the church
i went to the mosque
they call it God
they call it khuda
i ask myself
what's the difference
scientists say energy
why are they saying something else
who's right who's wrong
i am wondering
i look into myself
see only one truth
they call it haqq
we call it reality

la la la la la 
la la la la la 

i sing the praise to God
they call it frequency
it penetrates me
makes me happy
they call it nirvana
they call it sukun
call it what you want
it is but one
call it as you wish
it is only love

la la la la la 
la la la la la 
...

once upon a time
this water was gas
it evaporates
it became the cloud
then it fell as rain
into the ocean
now we call it sea
and we dive into it

la la la la la 
la la la la la 
don't get drowned in love
don't fall into lust
enjoy the coolness 
of the ocean
name it what you want
water ice or gas
it's one and the same thing
they call it h20
in the lab they trying to see
every bit of the quark
i tell you it's light
you tell me it is white
i tell you it's bright
you tell me it is shy

la la la la la 
la la la la la

ye jo tu ne suna: this that you heard
yehi meri pyare huzur ki
haqee...
qat hai: this is the reality of my beloved huzur
haq haq haq  ... true true true

wherever you turn
there is only haqq: there is only Truth
use what you want
study it as you want
as much as you feel
live it where you want
in the lab in the sea
in every moment of your life
you will only read
only love
you will only see
only light
ooo 
aaaa

i sing you in 1000 language
just to tell you the same thing
you call me scientist singer poet or anything
i'm just telling you 
this is the truth
stop fighting over shit
come bring your hands together
let us eat this peace cake
let us sing with love
let us hold hand
there is no barrier
human being you were made
only to fall in love
human being you're my brother
sister mother whatever
i don't care what you think of me
i don't give a shit
this is reality
we all have to live it

la la la la la

P: Ocean Song: Who is the Greatest

Who is the Greatest Greatest
Power in the universe ?
WHO is the Greatest Greatest
Power in the universe!

Sharks and  dolphins in the ocean
Sing His Praise day and night
Crabs and penguins crawl on the beach
Writing His Beautiful Name

Whales and seals in the sea
Whirl to His Glory
Sea turtles and all the fish
Swim by His Mercy

All algae and corals
are beautiful creatures
So humble, when they swirl
Thankful to their Creator

Phytoplanktons give oxygen
To all living nations
Giant icebergs provide iron
balancing toxic carbon

All the salts, tasty fish
Food for all humanity
Minerals and proteins
We get so much from the sea

Ya Muhyi Ya Hayyi 
May You Revive our sea
Ya Muhyi Ya Shafi
May You Heal our sea

Our sea
Our gorgeous sea
You’re so pretty
And shiny

When it is sunny
You make us happy
With your beauty
You’re so chilly

O giant blue
You’re so pure
We thank you
For all you do

All you give us
Big octopus
even fungus
You so generous

Your loving touch
nothing as such
so pleasing to us
Thank you very much

Our sea
Our gorgeous sea
You’re so pretty
And shiny

Ya Muhyi (O Reviver)
Ya Hayyi (O Alive)
Ya Muhyi (O Reviver)
Ya Shafi (O Healer)
