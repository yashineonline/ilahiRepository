Sadia Ghoor - A Tribute to "Uncle" Fazeel

Tribute to my Hero❤️ 
I write this post with tears in my eyes, because my heart is filled with Allahs love and mercy. Alhamdulillah 

I cannot begin to describe how special im feeling right now . Ya Allah Ya Hu 

The word Ansari came to my heart . We belong to the Ansari tariqa. Supporters and helpers to all mankind. I've received streams of messages from all over, of how Fazeel has helped them in many ways, and was so selfless in sharing his knowledge. Isnt this the trait of an Ansari? I am proud to be associated with an amazing soul like Fazeel & will continue walking down this path that he left off and   be the Ansari, Allah is happy with.. 

His words be simple, humble and good makes me smile today. He was truly a living example. Truly an angel in disguise.  I thank Allah for granting me 27 years of bliss with him. I look foward to reuniting with him in Jannah, when Allah is pleased with me in shaa Allah aameen 

He was such a wonderful man. I'm not sure I can really express just how much I will miss him. Not only was he a wonderful husband, but a wonderful father, , best friend, and so much more. 

He was my soul mate and my inspiration – my steadfast rock that helped me through thick and thin. Fazeel supported and loved us all, and was always there to help navigate through life’s challenges. 

Fazeel may be in looking at me now, with a big smile on his face saying,  "Come on now go ahead – make the best of life – and I’ll see you soon" 

Forever in my heart, until we meet again 

Yours truly❤️

As Salaamo Alaykum 

Something I want to share 
I can't thank Allah enough for all the blessings I see around me. Allah hu Akbar!!

I realised that we are faced with challenges /tests as we call it, but these are merely distractions that are put in our way. Like a road block!!
What do we do?
Stay stuck?
Or take another route to get to our destination??

Death of a family member is merely a distraction on our path to Allah. Do we just remain stuck at this road block for years?? Yes some of us do..

But instead of wasting time I asked Allah to guide me toward Him in a safer way. It won't be a short cut, or an easy route, but the journey will be adventurous for sure, because Allah is the Driver !!

I'm soo excited to take this detour as I know I will be with both of my beloved, Allah and Fazeel.

What could be more comforting than this?

How blind are we?
We living, yet we are dead. 
Showers of blessings, 
Lessons taught by Allah, are lost! 
because we are with ourselves!
How sad, that we are not paying attention to our teacher, our guide. 
So much is lost. 
Yet there's soooo much to gainl
Surrender is the password, for this life.
How many of us really do? 
We still want to be in control, when we are guided by the best! 
Life can be Good! 
Yes! 
Let us be guided towards the truth. 
Let us be guided by the best

Today I wake up in awe of your bounties Ya Allah! 
So much love & mercy enveloping me. 
Tears of happiness

Today I only see love, peace, togetherness and goodness around me. I'm swimming in an ocean of BLISS! 
Which of your favours can I deny? 
What do you want from me today , my beloved Allah? 
I'm just a mere slave, in awe of you! 
Gude me always to your path. The path of love.

Shaykh Nishaat :
Thank you for sharing this Sadia. It is so important for us all to understand that this journey is a continual striving to overcome the (lower) self, which is "the greater striving", as the Prophet Muhammad, pbuh, said.

This train that we are on will go from station to station, on to higher stations, moving from the 'Blaming Self' to the 'Inspired Self,' and then the 'Secure Self,' the 'Contented Self,' 'the Gratified Self,' and ultimately the 'Complete Self.'

P:
Sadia:
Your body is the carriage, to your soul
You can be healthy
You can be fit 
You can be strong 
But it will all end 
When you reach your End! 

Never forget you have an END 
We all have our own designated END 
There's no escape! 
Even if you had to hide in the tallest mountain  
Or the most beautiful palace 
You will face the end! 

This is the truth of life 
Let's not forget that you have an end 
So be careful not to spoil your end! 
Follow your heart and obey the laws of Allah 
Be simple, humble and good 
That is all it takes to have a successful End 

Guard your tongue
Guard your mind 
Guard your manners 
These are the keys to your successful End!

From this day forward,
Ask yourself 
What have done today
To deserve a successful End?

P:
I long for your smile, your laugh, your love
Ya Allah it's hard
But you, only you my Allah
Can mend my broken heart!

Life can never be the same
I look through a different lens
Some days it's bright 
Other times it's blurred 
Taking one day at a time 
It's another learning curve 

Our destination, is to Allah
To Allah we belong and unto is our return!
This separation, is my test of faith 
It's not forever, so today I will soldier on

May the Almighty grant me the strength 
To continue my journey with ease 
So I'm successful in this life. 
& the hereafter. 

Today I continue to ask Allah for guidance 
Today I will continue on this journey 
Today I look forward to a  beautiful day!

Food from the earth is Medicine for you
The way Allah intended for you 
What about your SOUL?
Your soul needs  your LOVE
Your soul needs  your CARE! 

Your soul lives on eternally 
Whilst the body perishes
Can you not see? 

Keep your soul alive in the remembrance of Allah
The source of your existence.
The battery of your power!
Can you not see?

Connect with your heart
And nourish your soul 
With Allah's names
Asma-ul-Husna 
His beautiful names!

Witness his love and mercy 
In his beautiful names
Subhana'Allah! 
Such blessings! 
Can you not see? 

Allah is my true power
The source of my existence 
The mender of my broken heart
In him I trust! 
I'm so thankful 
I can see the truth! 
Alhamdulillah!

Sabeeha
I had the privilege of meeting uncle Fazeel when I got back from Dubai and at that time I was the kind of person that would feel shy and out of place when meeting new people, however the warmth that I felt from Uncle Fazeel & his family made me feel comfortable and right at home. Uncle Fazeel would make the effort to come and greet me and ask me how I am after every zikr.. even though I should have been the one to go to him first. He was humble like that, and Allah's Love resonated through him. 

We were fortunate enough to have him as part of our Ansari Sufi Music Group where we got to share many laughs, common tastes in music even with the age difference and he told me "You are what they call an old soul." The memories that were created with him, will forever be kept close to my heart. He may not have been actual family to me but I was closer to him than any of my own uncle's. 

I was asked to make this video by Shaykh Nishaat & Aunty Dija... After much editing and reviewing... Choosing this song was easy in the end when i thought of what Uncle Fazeel would like... and I'm pretty confident he'd approve 🤗 

I hope this Video brings warmth to your hearts as it did to mine ❤️ 

Thank you Ya Allah for Uncle Fazeel & Thank You for the beautiful memories he's created with us ❤️

Tears of happiness.

Overflowing within me

For the love and support
Of my dearest friends and family

Life will never be the same

Ya Allah 
You took the closest thing to me, a family memeber

Ya Allah 
Alll I remember is my father praising your beautiful names 

Ya Allah 
Im 12 years old gonna be 13 in July and people phone and ask "How is Xia?" and we answer with "Alhamdulillah she is very strong and understanding"
but what we really want to say is "Mashaallah Xia is strong and I can't believe it" but why can't you believe it? Age doesn't matter! When someone asks "How old are you?" Then they feel like "Oh she is stilll small and she still has long to go" but "Do I really have many years to go before I return to Allah? No I don't because Allah is the planner and remember that we are not promised tomorrow, 20 years and even when I'm ninety

Ya Allah 
Please guide those people who say that because if they see a baby pass away then anyone can and there's nothing to be afraid of because we'll be with you, our rightful owner 

Ya Allah 
I ask myself "Why aren't I sad?"
Maybe because you blessed me with sabr 

My father may have left the whole world shocked and I am too but I know he is in good hands, with you of course 

Ya Allah 
In a click of a finger everything stops and I think "Ya Allah you the most merciful, the most high" 

Ya Wadud Ya Salaam Ya Jami Ya Nafi 
Love, Peace and Togetherness in Goodness

Ya Allah 
I took biat because I felt I needed

Memories are PRECIOUS 
Memories are PRICELESS  
All is possible! 
Only  by the WILL of  Allah 

You can do NOTHING 
To change your FATE
To change your LIFE 
Only by the WILL of Allah

Keep yourself occupied in this WORLD 
In the remembrance of Allah 
Making  beautiful MEMORIES 
Only by the Will of Allah 

Don't be fooled by this WORLD 
Its is a mere PLAY 
An illusion that you can't ESCAPE! 
Only  by the will of Allah 

You will never be able to RETURN
When you are GONE! 
You will never be able to make it RIGHT 
When you RETURN! 
Do your best NOW! 
Whilst you CAN! 
Only  by the WILL of Allah 

Keep Going on the right PATH 
Keep Going on your journey to ALLAH! 
Do your BEST! 
Your life is a mere TEST
Until you are met with the BEST! 

Ya Allah Ya Hu 
We are nothing without YOU 
Keep us steadfast in our PRAYERS 
Keep us connected to YOU! 

We are mere MORTALS 
Travelling through this WORLD 
With a MISSION 
The only MISSION 
To please YOU, our LORD 
Until our RETURN with  our full RECORD! 
Only by the will of Allah 

We ERR 
Yet you FORGIVE! 
We ERR 
Yet you FORGIVE! 
OVER AND OVER AGAIN 
How can we deny the TRUTH? 
When we are only shown the TRUTH! 

Everything in life happens by the will of Allah. 
Good or bad

Alhamdulillah! 
PRAISE BE TO ALLAH!

An empty chair
Holds you no more 
My heartbreak is real
I feel the struggle 
But
Allah has promised
for us left behind 
With every hardship comes ease! 

You are in a better place
A wonderful space! 
Your happiness knows no bounds
You're full of smiles 
Oh how so comforting!
But 
Allah has promised
for us left behind 
With every hardship comes ease! 

Life has changed overnight 
I'm awake at night 
Reminiscing the past 
Every single detail 
Every single one! 
But
Allah has promised 
for us left behind 
With every hardship comes ease! 

Life will never be the same 
There will be an emptiness! 
Knowing that you are in better place
A wonderful space 
Brings us great happiness!

Allah has promised 
for us left behind 
With every hardship comes ease!

A huge learning curve 
Alhamdulillah!

I will hold onto the rope of Allah
Just as my Allah has ordained 

You and I 
Are in a different space 
But our hearts are still connected
Our souls will live on 
Together forever!

I will hold firmly on to the rope of Allah 
Just as my Allah has ordained!

Life is too short.
Yet we can be so caught
With such small talk
That can become 
our destruction 
Come on now 
Follow Allah's instructions! 

Can you not see 
how life 
is meant To be
Pay  attention
And make an intention 
To change your life 
Waste not your time 
Your precious time
Go on now 
Make a difference! 

Judge not
For you know not
some situations 
Are beyond your understanding 
Don't be fooled 
Its all Allahs planning! 

Be smart 
With accomplishing your Goal 
For we don't know 
what tomorrow holds! 

Don't fall into the trap 
of Shaitans whispers
Protect yourself 
With your daily prayers 
Otherwise 
you will be left in jitters! 

Judge not
For you know not 
What's inside someone's heart 
Had you been in their situation 
You would not utter resistance 
But
Would run to their assistance! 

None of you will believe until you love for your brother what you love for yourself. (Al-Bukhari and Muslim)

You are a mere mortal

Don't try to interfere

with greater understanding! 

Learn from your past

You will see 
that with every trial 
Encountered 
Your Creator
has never faltered! 

This time too
you will pull through!  
Today's struggle 
will inspire you 
To become 
A true believer!  
Trust in your Creator

when he departs! 

Life can be tiresome 
with the 
excess baggage
For 
its a huge strain
on your carriage!
Forgiveness 
can only 
lighten the heart 
It's surely
is a 
blessed path! 
 
Will you still resist 
or still insist 
on another time 
whilst 
you have 
limited time 
Its time to ponder 
And make amends 
For your life 
can change 
on the next bend!

Ya Allah
grant peace
to our 
broken hearts
when we 
are 
falling apart! 
For we are 
sometimes weak 
and the future 
looks bleak! 

Even if
we believe
we do get weak
in 
our knees
For we are
only 
human beings
with 
limited
understanding
We pray 
that You
grant us
greater 
understanding! 

Sadness creeps in 
from
all directions 
Waves of
panic 
come and go
It is sometimes 
beyond 
our control! 

We can only
pray 
Ya Allah! 
Mend our 
broken hearts
free us from
this agony. 
Grant peace 
& tranquility 
with showers 
of Your 
infinite 
love and mercy
For we are
at 
Your mercy! 

To Allah we belong and to Him is our return

This Ramadaan can

With every hardship comes ease 
Trust that He is the

All Loving Most Merciful 
That new door

Be observant 
and always be grateful

We have lots
of opportunities
to reflect on
our lives in
Ramadaan
A time to
reset our thoughts 
and 
actions to reality
detoxing ourselves 
of all superficial thoughts 
and lingering debris 
clearing the path
paving our way 
back to Allah
the way it was 
intended 
from 
the beginning of 
our existence. 
We are blessed 
to be given 
an opportunity 
every year to 
to better ourselves 
transform our thoughts 
and be reminded 
of our priorities 
in life 
It takes 21 days to make 
a habit but Allah 
has given us
more time 
more opportunities 
Don't be neglectful 
make every 
second count 
for this may
be the last time 
you are given this 
golden opportunity 
Let's be grateful 
and feed
our thirsty and hungry 
soul with all
the nutrition 
it needs to 
make us strong 
and prosperous 
believers
May Alllah be pleased with us and may He accept all our efforts and prayers

Grieving or losing
a loved one 
is a painful journey
as perceived 
by those left behind
but for Allah it's 
Love 
So much love 
for you that 
you are raised 
higher in ranks 
an honour
if you only knew 
The void you 
are feeling in 
your heart 
will slowly be 
filled with
Allah's Divine Love 
Eternal Love 
an enviable position 
indeed
Know that all
those tears 
are not in vain 
Remain patient

Keep striving
to do your best 
and Allah 
will take care 
of the rest

We never really know 
about hardships or challenges 
until we go 
through it ourselves 
During this time 
it is so easy to 
get caught up
in our own world 
and go astray 
as sadness and depression 
creep in 
Anger and frustration 
overwhelm you 
every single day
and before you know it 
you are trapped 
This is the ploy of Shaitaan 
We as human beings
have the free will to make 
the right choices
Use this time 
to strengthen your
relationship
with your Creator 
A wonderful opportunity 
to use this
transformation period
to better yourself 
Share a smile 
spread the love 
for this becomes 
a healing for 
you too
Instead of comforting 
your lower self 
and drowning in sorrow 
Turn to your Lord 
and experience 
your healing journey 
with Him
Start the new 
chapter of your life 
knowing that you 
are guided by the Best
Peace and contentment 
will be your lasting impression 
its simply
the best decision

We are brought 
to our knees in prayer 
All our attention and focus
is on our Creator

because in life we are faced 
with many distractions 
but when going through 
challenges or tests 
Allah has our full 
attention so much so 
that we take extra time 
in our prayers 
This is the wisdom 
of Allah 
bringing back our attention
to Him
not for Him
but for our benefit 
so we can make our lives 
better the way He intended 
Allah is the Source of
love and mercy 
Let's be thankful today

nothing without Him

Passing our time

The sadness we feel 
when we remember

during special occasions 
is heartbreaking 
But
Their celebrations are 
more pompous 
with Allah
It gives solace to the heart 
knowing that there's no 
worry, stress , anxiety

Just Eternal Peace 
Just as we crave in this life 
Wipe those tears, lift a smile

The pain, suffering 
and injustices experienced by the 
Palestinians is heartbreaking 
Never have we seen killings happening 
so freely without media coverage 
Where is the empathy , mercy and love of another human being ?
Why is the whole world not with them?
This is pure injustice!
Will you just stand by and watch this 
happen in your country ?
What is their punishment that the world looks on silently ?
We will be answerable for our actions by God
The least you can do is lift your hands and pray that they are granted ease ,peace and freedom 
That's empathy! 
Caring for another human being irrespective of caste, colour in creed 
Soften your hearts and do 
the right thing 🙌

Today is a special day 
A day of Eid Celebrations 
that our Merciful & Beloved Creator has bestowed upon us after a month long fast.
For many of us, life will never be the same, but Trusting in the Almighty and holding on to the rope of Allah, brings much solace to our hearts. Knowing that He is All Wise and All Knowing, our lives will be filled with a different kind of happiness again. This is the promise of our most Beloved Creator. Our loved ones that have left this world are fortunate to be in the presence of Allah this Eid, an envious position indeed. We are all waiting in line, for our turn. Until then, let's not waste this special day, in sadness. Let's make them proud by remembering their smiles and memories, with much happiness for they are in Eternal joy and happiness.
From my family to yours, Eid Mubarak, Taqaballa Allahu minna wa minkum! May it be filled with much happiness and remembrance of Allah!

Have you ever thought 
how you passed through 
life with a successful career 
and overflowing wealth ?
Do you still think it's
your doing because you
studied and worked hard 
Yes partially it may be you 
But how did you get through it ?
Remember everything 
in life happens by the will of God 
Your career, your studies, 
your financial stability 
all happened by the permission

Count your blessings

But 
sometimes it becomes difficult 
when consumed by the situation
Life becomes unbearable

Turning to Him

It's through this patience 
you will develop your strength

Its heartbreaking to 
continue life without 
our loved ones 
especially when our lives 
were so perfect 
and beautiful 
Life can change in 
a split second 
Adjustments to live 
without them comes
with no survival manual
But with the guidance 
of our Creator 
the impossible
becomes possible
the cries turn to peace 
and the heart 
starts mending slowly 
It's a daily struggle 
a new struggle 
But with every hardship 
comes ease
The light seems so far away 
but with patience 
and strong faith 
a flicker of light is seen
from a distance 
slowly becoming brighter 
each day 
Taking it one day at a time 
becomes the norm
It's surely a long 
transformation process 
But your life story becomes
a survival kit 
for someone else
Giving someone else hope 
and strength becomes 
a healing for you too 
We are constantly 
reminded with this experience 
that this temporary abode 
is a stopover 
to an Eternal life with 
our beloved Creator 
Being patient will 
be rewarding one day 
Keep striving to be your best 
living your life knowing 
that a beautiful Eternal life 
awaits you
reunited with all
your loved ones

Happiness is knowing 
that you have a 
Creator that loves you

more than you

Challenges are 
no longer seen as 
a calamity but rather 
a training program to
reach higher ranks 
A place our Beloved Creator 
wants for you 
His beloved servant 
A blessing indeed 
It's hard to comprehend 
if we are distant 
from the truth 
but if you pay attention 
you will see the 
Eternal Love
showering upon you 
An envious position indeed 
We can only pray 
for God to open our eyes 
and our heart to 
see His bounties 
and His signs 
It's all visible

life through a

We will be in awe

Through separation  
of a loved one
the heart 
goes through periods 
of longing and yearning 
The absence
of our loved one’s 
stir up emotions 
deep rooted in the soul 
so deep that you are wounded 
on a level no one understands
except for our Mighty God  
Creator of our heart 
Creator of everything 
It's through these experiences
we learn about ourselves 
Have you pondered on 
how beautifully our Creator 
has made each and every 
bond possible 
of all the special people
in our life 
Every soul is connected,
bonded in perfection as one
A relationship that was formed 
before we even came
into existence 
It's through separation
we learn how fortunate 
we are to be given 
an opportunity to 
experience this beautiful 
unison of souls 
Everything in our life 
is planned by Him 
So its a reminder to me
first and foremost
to thank God
every single day 
for all the bonds we shared
with our loved ones 
that have departed 
as well as the strong bonds 
that still exist in our lives 
for it wouldn't be possible 
without Him

To surrender 
in life is to 
cut off all attachments 
that tie you down
or distract you 
on your journey 
to your Creator 
It's hard not 
to worry or stress
about a situation 
especially since 
it's all that you did 
since the time of 
your existence 
How do you 
unlearn everything?
This is the biggest 
challenge in life 
To Surrender 
To let go 
To cut off all attachments 
one by one 
till you become one 
with the One 
It's a lifelong mission 
a difficult one indeed 
But 
with difficulty
always comes ease
as promised by our 
beloved Creator 
It's about changing 
our attitude 
and redirecting our focus 
back to our Creator 
The Best of Planners 
The All Knowing, The All Wise

life towards the truth with ease 
A feeling of freedom 
is experienced 
Freedom of guilt, worry 
and all negativity

Be grateful for all

I have never fully 
understood the
meaning of surrender 
until I had to implement
it in my life 
over and over again 
The key to happiness 
in this world 
is to surrender 
to let go 
and let the
Best of Planner
our Beloved Creator 
do what's best
for you and me 
It's hard to let go
when we are 
so attached to 
everything around us 
Letting go is like 
losing a part of you 
but in reality 
it's becoming 
whole again 
Becoming the person 
you were meant to be 
With this act of surrender 
you are totally free 
from this worldly
attachments 
And become one with the

A brightness appears 
the vision becomes clearer

is your Lord 
There is 
no more loneliness 
no more sorrow 
Just so much gratitude

Being Fearless 
is a difficult task 
especially since 
we are mostly 
dominated by 
our lower self 
day in day out 
To Surrender 
to the will of Allah 
and being Fearless 
are two most 
important qualities 
to possess 
to live life here 
in this temporary world
Without these 
qualities we will 
always fall prey 
to our dominating 
lower self 
full of depression 
anxiety, stress and 
neverending health issues 
If only we could see 
all the blessings before us 
we would not hesitate 
to run towards our 
Beloved Creator 
May we always be reminded of the Supreme Power of our Creator and know that He alone is the Owner of Everything

Life is a series 
of experiences
Each one brings 
out a series 
of emotions 
of love, happiness, 
sadness excitement, 
joy, anger, frustration 
We have the 
option of looking 
at life as 
good or bad 
or just good 
accompanied 
by lessons 
Looking at it
on a positive note 
everything happens 
for our higher good 
to bring out 
a beautiful transformation 
within us so 
we are strengthened 
to our 
Source of Existence 
This connection 
weakens as we live 
our daily lives 
unconsciously 
But 
our Beloved Creator 
has our best interest 
at heart always and 
makes the 
impossible possible 
Know that whatever 
is happening right 
now with you 
will bring 
out the best 
in you irrespective 
of the circumstances 
you are facing 
Trust in Him
The All Knowing All Wise 
We can only pray 
that He continues 
to guide us to the truth 
with ease

Love is the 
basic foundation 
for every relationship 
be it a mother, father,
spouse, friend or 
even a stranger 
It's all love for 
the pleasure of Allah 
No need to know 
the person to love 
them because every 
single person out 
there is connected to you 
via the Source of Love  
our beloved Allah 
Humanity can only 
improve their quality 
of life here in this world 
if there's love for each other 
It's wonderful to see 
how love can bring out 
the best in you 
Such a beautiful feeling 
to see another human 
smile and know that 
you have made 
a difference 
in their lives 
This world needs
more love 
and less judging 
Let's make this 
life a pleasurable one
by spreading love 
amongst each other 
and restore 
our world with 
much love, peace, togetherness 
in goodness the 
way Allah intended

We all face 
some form 
of hardship 
But it's important 
to note 
that 
Allah does not 
burden a soul 
more than it 
can handle 
We may feel 
overwhelmed at first 
but deep within 
as you surrender 
your strength surfaces 
so much so 
that you overcome the 
obstacles on your 
path to Allah 
and you become 
the beacon of hope 
for others 
going through
similar challenges 
It's an amazing plan 
laid out by 
our Beloved Allah 
So we are a means 
of healing for
each other 
This connects us 
all to our Source of Light 
to the Most Merciful and 
Most Loving Allah 
With much guidance 
and permission
by the Almighty 
hardships are overcome 
strength and patience 
overflows and life 
takes on a new dimension 
increasing one's faith 
and transforming 
one to becoming a
devoted believer 
a successful representative 
of Allah the Most High 
Allah hu Akbar!
