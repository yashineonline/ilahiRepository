Shaykh Taner Vargonen Ansari

P: Become Me, Love Me
The Lord: Oh, my servant,
If you want to be Me,
Stop being you.

You cannot know Me
By being you.
You can only know Me
By being Me.

I wanted to love you
So I became you.
If you want to love Me,
Become Me.

P: What is you and what is me?
What is you and what is me?
Your nafs is you. You, is what you want to be.
When you are what 'I' want you to be,
Then it is not you.
In the fight against your nafs, you forget the essence of things.
The essence of things is to enjoy Allah and to focus on Allah.
Love is the thing.
When you are in the fight, 
you need to make a habit of remembering Allah.
In the fight against your nafs, you need to remember Allah too.
You can bypass all these with the love you have in your heart
Your quest is to surrender your brain to your heart.

P: The Sun and The Clouds
The sun is always shining. It is the clouds that block its light 
as your nafs blocks the light of your heart.

P: Teaching with Love
If Allah wants to teach you something, 
first He gives you the curiosity about it 
and then He gives you the love for it 
and then the means (makes it possible 
and gives you the knowledge) for it.
This means Allah is doing this.

When you want to do something, 
if it is not happening, 
then, it means Allah does not want it. 
This is not your thing.

P: Love and Hope
Love is the flavour of life.
Love is the oasis in the desert, lifesaver in the sea.
It's the rope for the mountaineers.
It's the hope for the hopeless.

P: Love in the Universe
    The universe is a manifestation 
    of Allah's mercy and love. 
    To know this is to see that everything, 
    even our struggles, 
    is  designed to bring us closer to Him.

P: Uniting Love
    The goal of Sufism is to unite your purpose with Allah's purpose, 
    to unite your existence with Allah's existence, 
    to unite your love with Allah's love. 
    Everything needs to be aligned. 
    When you start doing this, then the purpose becomes one. 
    We call this tawhid, oneness.

P: Observe Love with Love
    Our job is to observe, appreciate, love Allah 
    with the love He is giving us. 
    And not to object to whatever He is trying to teach us. 
    He can put you into different situations to teach you different things. 
    If you keep objecting, how are you going to learn?

P: Legacy of Love
Love is a legacy 
you can leave behind and take it with you at the same time.
It is a treasure 
that you can give away as much as you want 
but it never decreases.
The more you give it, 
the more you have it….

P: Love is Fire
Allah wants love. 
Love is not compelled. 
There is no compulsion in love. 
You love or you do not love. 
You cannot force yourself to love. 
If you love, you love; 
if you do not love, you do not. 
You surrender to that. 
But Allah wants to be loved. 
Make your goal to love Allah. 
Surrender to that. 
The biggest action is love. 
The biggest being is love. 
The shortest distance to Allah is love. 
The biggest asset that burns all incompleteness is love. 
That is why our Pir Ahmed er Rifai said, 
“Love is fire, love is fire, love is fire.”

P: Allah Wants Nothing But Love
Allah created this entire universe, 
for love. 
He wanted to be seen, 
He wanted to be admired, 
and He wanted to be loved 
without force, without compulsion. 
Allah says in Qur'an-i-Karim that 
there is no compulsion in religion. 
We cannot compel these things. 
If He wanted, 
everybody would believe, 
but He wants these things 
to be done voluntarily, on our own. 
We have to come to the recognition of this 
and admire God 
and love God 
and profess this.

P: Experience Love
When you adorn yourself with 
patience, kindness and tolerance, 
and then 
understanding and generosity, 
Allah will lower His love 
down on you. 
Then you will experience the love. 
If you are not experiencing this love 
in your life, 
something is wrong 
with your attitude 
and the way 
you are doing things.

P: A Blessed House of Love
A blessed house 
is a house open to guests, 
a blessed house 
is a house open to loving people, 
a house with guests in it 
is a blessed house. 
A blessed house 
is a house open to true love.

P: Production of Love
Allah can use you 
for the purpose of 
increasing your understanding 
of Allah better, 
and this will produce love. 
That is why 
good adab, good manners, 
are important. 
And that is why 
it is especially important 
for Zikr to be done 
with intention and connection. 

P: Where is Love?
Continue seeing the Creator
in the created,
and contemplate on this,
and love Allah
in your Shaykh
because your Shaykh
loves Allah
in you.

P: Adab
Adab is derived from what pleases Allah 
and what does not please Allah. 
So knowing these things 
and making it a part of you 
and acting with these things 
is the base for adab. 

So adab is actually 
a communication device. 
You are also communicating. 
To whom? 
By interacting with each other, 
you think I am interacting 
with my wife, 
with my husband, 
or friends, this that, 
actually you are interacting 
with the whole universe. 
Everybody is listening to it, 
there is nothing secret, 
whatever you are doing. 
Angels know. 
You remember? 
Allah says 
you have two angels: 
angels write your good deeds 
or 
angels write your bad deeds. 
It means 
they are always with you; 
they know whatever you are doing 
and it is being written.

In Sufism, we try to teach you an adab 
that is pleasing to Allah. 
If you learn and act with it, 
that will get you closer to Allah. 

For example, 
doing your assignment everyday, 
that is an adab. 
Putting Allah in front of anything else 
is a very good adab. 
And treating each other 
for the sake of Allah 
with love 
and compassion 
and forgiveness 
is a very good adab. 
Speaking soft is a good adab. 
Allah likes these things. 

Our Prophet (peace be upon him) 
likes those 
who keep together, 
who do not break hearts 
and help people 
and keep the society positive. 
That is a good adab. 

And these attract blessings of Allah 
through angels and etc. 
Allah creates these angels 
that pray for you until the Judgment Day.

P: Doing with Understanding and Love
It is important 
to understand 
what you are doing. 
And whatever you are doing 
for Allah, 
do it with an understanding 
and especially with love 
from your heart. 
It has to come from your heart 
whatever you are doing. 
Do everything for Allah's sake 
and then do not regret.

P: Everything is for love
Now as Sufis, 
we should all focus on Allah 
and do everything for Allah's sake 
and do not expect anything in return 
except we are of course trying to earn Allah's love 
that we want to receive, 
whether Allah gives it or not, 
that is His business 
but we will keep on trying. 
So everything is for love. 
If you take love away 
then there is just business.
