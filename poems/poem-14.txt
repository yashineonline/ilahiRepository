P: Time is an element of Alchemy The transformation of energy

Don't lose your focus
On time

Align your focus
In time to transform

Have your focus
Transmit through Source
Transfuse through soul

Under the element time transpire
Willful power of spirit

Don't be limited by capacity
Be limitless through connection

Energy cannot be spent
The more energy you use
The more of power one transcends

Energy cannot be created nor destroyed
Energy cannot live nor die

You are
Because light IS
Only to transition from ONE
Form
To the next


P: My ExiStENCE Purpose
Existence contains exit
Within it accommodates 'I'
The most of it however is essence
For when I exit all there is
Is Your essence

Not knowing You
I know not who I am

Knowing you exist

Explains my existence
PURPOSE

P: A Treasure to be known

Bringing life to the surface
Creation bursting fourth
With The Big Bang
Truths be spoken
Hidden in a theory
The only Living Life
Huu created you
Created me

The Driving Force
Blew you into a vessel
A body
Filled with potential
Kinetically capable
To transform
Calming nature
To a havoc rising storm

All with a purpose
Beating in your heart
A Rapture
There's a reason
We've been born

All Allah said, was
"Be", and it is
And all else was
Till it all came to Be
Beginning with time

For you and all
To see
A treasure
To be known
In each
Existing particle
That forms every cell
Following their systems
Each a story to tell
Of What matters most

From One
To All
From All
To One
Life is a lesson
Living is a course
Observational witnesses
Of Thee Only One
The One and Only Source

P: Birthday Poem
O Dear Beloved Sheyim. 
I would say it was love at first sight. 
But I loved you with my heart before I loved you with my sight. 
As a kid I use to think my Shaykh stole my heart. 
I couldn't understand why I loved you so much before I even laid eyes on you. 
But now I know it's your heart that lives in me.

Then I met my Shaykh and discovered why.

Because of Allah's love that's why. 
Because my Shaykh travels the universe with the company of Rasulullah PBUH, 
the representative of habiballah that's why.

We can see the universe in my Shaykh's crystal blue eyes 
but that's not why we love you so much. 
When we are with you Shaykh 
all our worries disappear, 
no fear 
everything is clear. 
I book a healing consultation, 
see my Shaykh 
and forget I had an ailment. 
My Shaykh answered most of our questions 
without having us verbally ask them. 
Then we end up hearing our Shaykh and Shaykha answer questions we whisper only with our hearts. 
But that's not why we love Awliyallah.

Lol haha hehe I don't think the sum of all the people who have ever made me laugh has made me laugh more than my Shaykh. 
Whenever I see my Shaykhs face I think of Allah. 
Whenever I see my Shaykha's face I think of Allah. 
So I ask myself am I looking at my Shaykh or am I looking at Allah. 
Then I see Allah smiling back at me. 
And Then, when I see my Shaykh look at our Anne, 
I really melt in love then all I'm led to think of is Allah's love. 
Whenever I see the Ansari family then what I'm led to think of is Allah's LOVE, Allah's family. 
I'm truly happy and grateful to be a witness of Allah's love story. 
To have ever lived the dream of kissing your palm and rubbing your feet. 
Happy birthday my dear Sheyim! I love you with all of my souls beloved Baba.

Thank you Ya Allah for sharing your Wadud with us.
