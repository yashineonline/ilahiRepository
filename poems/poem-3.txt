Shaykh Nishaat Ahmed Siddiqi

P: The Goal
The goal for the human being, 
especially in the Sufi path, 
is to know and to love Allah. 
Allah is The Beloved, The One, The Only. 

All the laws, the rules, the rituals, 
all the prophets throughout time, 
and the friends of Allah, 
both men and women, 
have come to teach 
this one truth 
- to know Allah.

Sufism 
is the name of this teaching, 
the path that offers a method 
to attain this goal. 
To reach it, 
one must become Insan-i Kamil, 
the mature human being, 
one who reflects 
the Attributes of Allah.

P: Life with potholes
Life, 
with every pothole, 
is one long road trip. 
It’s not about rushing to get somewhere. 
It’s about every little thing along the way. 
There will be songs that make you smile, 
and quiet moments that make you think. 
Sometimes you’ll take a wrong turn 
and find something better.
Sometimes you’ll slow down 
and realise 
that there was no need to hurry. 
You’ll meet people 
who will help you grow. 
You’ll lose things 
that were never meant for you. 
You’ll have hard days, 
but you’ll also have ones 
filled with beauty 
in the most simple things. 
Don’t worry too much 
about the destination. 
Every step, 
even the tough ones, 
is part of the journey. 
Just keep  going. 
Keep smiling. 
There’s still so much 
to see, 
so much 
to appreciate 
and learn, 
and so many moments 
to treasure.

You’re doing better than you think.
