Shaykh Taner Vargonen Ansari

Love is the greatest power on earth and the universe.

Love is hard to get but it is the combining chemistry of everything. 

Love is the fusion between you and everything and everything and everything.

Love is the chemistry where you and I are dissolved.

Love is the chemical in which your impurities are dissolved and the gold within yourself is left glowing.

Love is the magnetic force, the connection, the best connection you can have between you and Allah.

Love is the best method of migration, by which you leave your nafs and unite with your Beloved.

Have you ever asked love where she is coming from, where is she going to and where is her home?

Love is giving yourself to the beloved and not asking it back.
  
Make your goal to love Allah. Surrender to that. 
  
The biggest action is love. 
  
The biggest being is love. 
  
The shortest distance to Allah is love. 
  
The biggest asset that burns all incompleteness is love.

LOVE MAKES ONENESS

Love brings people together.

If you want to represent Islam, then you have to be an element of peace, love, togetherness, kindness, mercy and knowledge.

We must be wary when certain actions are promoted as earning you certain units of paradise. Allah's love outweighs fear mongering.

Love comes from the heart of the believers, the acceptors of Truth, the mu'minun.

When there is love and softness, it is from Allah. When there is vanity, selfishness, greed, lust and so on, it is from the nafs.
