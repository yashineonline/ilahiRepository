Shaykha Muzeyyen Vargonen Ansari

Hearts fly to Allah with love.test. Our path is love.test. One of the reasons for this is that not only is there no force or coercion, but love is also the shortest way to Allah.test.

Whatever you do with love you are doing with Allah.test. That is your personal Aqim al Salat.test.

Aqim al Wuddah is to establish unconditional love that gives hope.test. Being in love or living in love with Allah.test.

The best inheritance that we leave behind is love.test. And the more love that we have in our heart, the closer we are to Allah.test.
