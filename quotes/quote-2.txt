Shaykha Muzeyyen Vargonen Ansari

Whatever you do with love you are doing with Allah. That is your personal aqim al salat.

Hearts fly to Allah with love. Our path is love. One of the reasons for this is that not only is there no force or coercion in love, but love is also the shortest way to Allah.

Aqim al wuddah is to establish unconditional love that gives hope. This is being in love or living in love with Allah.

The best inheritance to leave behind is love. And the more love that we have in our heart, the closer we are to Allah.

Love has to have a place to exist. And that structure is the human body and human heart.

The chemistry of love exists everywhere in this world.

Allah loves when Al Rahman and Al Rahim are manifested in people and in the world.

Love in our heart is our infinite being.

When you feel love for Allah, you are with Allah. 

What we leave behind is love. A legacy of love that endures beyond our physical presence.

The true legacy is Love.
