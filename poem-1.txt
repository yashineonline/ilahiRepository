Shaykh Taner Vargonen Ansari

P: What is you and what is me?
What is you and what is me?
Your nafs is you. You, is what you want to be.
When you are what 'I' want you to be,
Then it is not you.
In the fight against your nafs, you forget the essence of things.
The essence of things is to enjoy Allah and to focus on Allah.
Love is the thing.
When you are in the fight, 
you need to make a habit of remembering Allah.
In the fight against your nafs, you need to remember Allah too.
You can bypass all these with the love you have in your heart
Your quest is to surrender your brain to your heart.

P: The Sun and The Clouds
The sun is always shining. It is the clouds that block its light 
as your nafs blocks the light of your heart.

P: Teaching with Love
If Allah wants to teach you something, 
first He gives you the curiosity about it 
and then He gives you the love for it 
and then the means (makes it possible 
and gives you the knowledge) for it.
This means Allah is doing this.

When you want to do something, 
if it is not happening, 
then, it means Allah does not want it. 
This is not your thing.

P: Love and Hope
Love is the flavour of life.
Love is the oasis in the desert, lifesaver in the sea.
It's the rope for the mountaineers.
It's the hope for the hopeless.

P: Love in the Universe
    The universe is a manifestation 
    of Allah's mercy and love. 
    To know this is to see that everything, 
    even our struggles, 
    is  designed to bring us closer to Him.

P: Uniting Love
    The goal of Sufism is to unite your purpose with Allah's purpose, 
    to unite your existence with Allah's existence, 
    to unite your love with Allah's love. 
    Everything needs to be aligned. 
    When you start doing this, then the purpose becomes one. 
    We call this tawhid, oneness.

P: Observe Love with Love
    Our job is to observe, appreciate, love Allah 
    with the love He is giving us. 
    And not to object to whatever He is trying to teach us. 
    He can put you into different situations to teach you different things. 
    If you keep objecting, how are you going to learn?

P: Legacy of Love
Love is a legacy 
you can leave behind and take it with you at the same time.
It is a treasure 
that you can give away as much as you want 
but it never decreases.
The more you give it, 
the more you have it….

P: Love is Fire
Allah wants love. 
Love is not compelled. 
There is no compulsion in love. 
You love or you do not love. 
You cannot force yourself to love. 
If you love, you love; 
if you do not love, you do not. 
You surrender to that. 
But Allah wants to be loved. 
Make your goal to love Allah. 
Surrender to that. 
The biggest action is love. 
The biggest being is love. 
The shortest distance to Allah is love. 
The biggest asset that burns all incompleteness is love. 
That is why our Pir Ahmed er Rifai said, 
“Love is fire, love is fire, love is fire.”

P: Allah Wants Nothing But Love
Allah created this entire universe, 
for love. 
He wanted to be seen, 
He wanted to be admired, 
and He wanted to be loved 
without force, without compulsion. 
Allah says in Qur'an-i-Karim that 
there is no compulsion in religion. 
We cannot compel these things. 
If He wanted, 
everybody would believe, 
but He wants these things 
to be done voluntarily, on our own. 
We have to come to the recognition of this 
and admire God 
and love God 
and profess this.

P: Experience Love
When you adorn yourself with 
patience, kindness and tolerance, 
and then 
understanding and generosity, 
Allah will lower His love 
down on you. 
Then you will experience the love. 
If you are not experiencing this love 
in your life, 
something is wrong 
with your attitude 
and the way 
you are doing things.
