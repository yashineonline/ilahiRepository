P: Birthday Poem
O Dear Beloved Sheyim. 
I would say it was love at first sight. 
But I loved you with my heart before I loved you with my sight. 
As a kid I use to think my Shaykh stole my heart. 
I couldn't understand why I loved you so much before I even laid eyes on you. 
But now I know it's your heart that lives in me.

Then I met my Shaykh and discovered why.

Because of Allah's love that's why. 
Because my Shaykh travels the universe with the company of Rasulullah PBUH, 
the representative of habiballah that's why.

We can see the universe in my Shaykh's crystal blue eyes 
but that's not why we love you so much. 
When we are with you Shaykh 
all our worries disappear, 
no fear 
everything is clear. 
I book a healing consultation, 
see my Shaykh 
and forget I had an ailment. 
My Shaykh answered most of our questions 
without having us verbally ask them. 
Then we end up hearing our Shaykh and Shaykha answer questions we whisper only with our hearts. 
But that's not why we love Awliyallah.

Lol haha hehe I don't think the sum of all the people who have ever made me laugh has made me laugh more than my Shaykh. 
Whenever I see my Shaykhs face I think of Allah. 
Whenever I see my Shaykha's face I think of Allah. 
So I ask myself am I looking at my Shaykh or am I looking at Allah. 
Then I see Allah smiling back at me. 
And Then, when I see my Shaykh look at our Anne, 
I really melt in love then all I'm led to think of is Allah's love. 
Whenever I see the Ansari family then what I'm led to think of is Allah's LOVE, Allah's family. 
I'm truly happy and grateful to be a witness of Allah's love story. 
To have ever lived the dream of kissing your palm and rubbing your feet. 
Happy birthday my dear Sheyim! I love you with all of my souls beloved Baba.

Thank you Ya Allah for sharing your Wadud with us.
