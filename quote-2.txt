“Hearts fly to Allah with love. Our path is love. One of the reasons for this is that not only is there no force or coercion, but love is also the shortest way to Allah.”

*Murshida Shaykha Muzeyyen Vargonen Ansari*

"Whatever you do with love you are doing with Allah. That is your personal Aqim al Salat"
